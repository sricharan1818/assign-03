#  Concept : 2d Lists  

'''
Suppose that you are given an image, which is not in a stright view then you have to rotate it to 90 degrees to a convenient side. 

Considering that an image is a collection of pixels which looks like a 2d array or 2d list or Matrix, we apply this technique towards the Matrix with our own logic and rotate a Matrix.

If you know how to rotate a Matrix you can also write or use the same logic to rotate an image

 Example take the matrix below which you have to rotate left side 90 degree,

  ## Representation

  10 20 30

  40 50 60

  70 80 90

  ### After Rotation

  30 60 90

  20 50 80

  10 40 70 

  ## Input
  
  3

  3

  10

  20

  30

  40

  50

  60

  70

  80

  90


  ## Output

  30 60 90

  20 50 80

  10 40 70
