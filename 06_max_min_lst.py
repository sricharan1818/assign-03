# Concept : Dictionaries
# Find Max and Min Value in a dictionary

'''
You will be given a dictionary with a key-value pair

for each key "k" there will be a list [v1,v2,v3,v4] as value

your first task is to find the max and min of each list of each key

example

d1 = {"a":[20,30,10,1], "b":[10,100,1000,3], "c":[30,50,2,5]}

the max and min for "a" is 30 and 1
the max and min for "b" is 1000 and 3
the max and min for "c" is 50 and 2

You have to finally return the list of keys which is having the max and min value 

So for the above dictionary the list will be ["b", "a"] as [max,min] -> "b" having 1000 and "a" having 1
