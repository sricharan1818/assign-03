Each file contains one function, for which you have to write the implementation.

After completing the implementation to check the correctness. 
Use the following command, in the terminal. Example to test the correctness of first problem.
```

```

Note: Make sure you are in the directory which contains these files when you run this command.

+ What is first logic that you thought for solving the problem?
+ What is the problems you faced while implementing your first logic?
+ Did you modify the logic to solve it or the first logic worked?

Answer these 3 questions for each of the 6 problems in the file `07_observation.txt`.
